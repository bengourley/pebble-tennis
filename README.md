# Pebble Badminton

Built by a Badminton player for Badminton players. Keep track of the score in your Badminton matches with simple controls and a clean, uncluttered interface.

Match formats are easily configured inside the app and it defaults to the settings you last used. If yours isn't configurable, let me know because I want to support all commonly played formats.
