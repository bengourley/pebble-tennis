[![Available on the Pebble store](http://pblweb.com/badge/572a8209381261f35e00000a/orange/small)](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/572a8209381261f35e00000a)

Built by a tennis player for tennis players. Keep track of the score in your tennis matches with simple controls and a clean, uncluttered interface.

Match formats are easily configured inside the app and it defaults to the settings you last used. If your yours isn't configurable, let me know because I want to support all commonly played formats.
